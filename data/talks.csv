If there's a problem there's an opportunity. I love travelling the world and doing hiking here in Colombia. ¡I will not rest until my two scratchable maps are 100% complete!,UruIT,Colombia,Colombia,Talk (40 minutes including Q&A) /  Charla (40 minutos incluyendo preguntas),English / Inglés,Spanish / Español,Building a Scalable Food Delivery Service Using ElasticSearch Geo Queries,"**** Submission description ****

With the rise of food delivery services in Colombia, it’s a good time to discuss the technical aspects involved in their operation. How do they manage to provide a list of the nearest available restaurants to your location within seconds? How do they manage to handle thousands of request and still display updated information taking into account schedules? With ElasticSearch Geo Queries we can set up a fully functional service that can scale to satisfy the growing demand of users that want their lunch delivered to their home in a reasonable amount of time.

**** Why are you the right person to give this talk? ****
(Answering here because the field has a weird bug regarding punctuation)

I worked at Domicilios.com for over two years. I started there in 2016 as a backend engineer for the company's internal tools, but given the increased demand of users and the inability of our stack to provide reasonable response times, I was moved to the core team. In this new phase we were responsible of providing scalable solutions to handle the incredible expansion the market was suffering back in 2017. 

We started optimizing the API, both in code and infrastructure but it was not enough: an increase of order cancellations and bad reviews in our app and in social networks told us that our efforts were not sufficient. That's when we decided to move our geolocation service from code and traditional databases to ElasticSearch. We did several spikes with different geolocation technologies and we loved the Elastic solution. We spent months trying to setup the right architecture and coordinating data between our main database and ES to avoid displaying outdated information. 

But then the results came. We managed to decrease the load time in our application by several seconds. Now our users were able to locate within a second or two their favorite restaurants and place and order without the hassle of waiting for the information to load.

Code that has not been written by us is always ugly, not performant, and broken.

How does one go about inheriting other people’s code? How do you wrap your head around the (wrong?) ideas, the (flawed?) logic, and the (lack of?) taste of other developers(?)? How can you take such code, make it yours, make it better, and sprinkle your fairy dust all over it? Also, do you really really really write better code? ;)

Description: When mentioning Time Series Forecasting what comes to mind are autoregressive models or exponential smoothing techniques using a dependent variable and the time dimension. Although those techniques work well in some domains, in others like retail, e-commerce, logistic and pricing, time series can be influenced by external factors that are hard to model using these traditional methods.

When posing time series forecasting as a regression problem, one can use machine learning techniques like linear regression and support vector machines as well as more advanced models such as neural nets and boosted trees to perform the forecast. The main challenge here is not related to the particular machine learning technique but to the data preparation and feature engineering necessary to create powerful predictors.

The talk is divided in three sections: in the first section I will briefly describe time series and their applications; common evaluation metrics, the models used traditionally to work with them and the limitations they bring. In the second I will focus on modeling, describing some machine learning methodologies, useful predictors and transformations that improve their predictive power. Finally I will combine the aforementioned concepts in small code samples using publicly available datasets to show how to apply some of these techniques using Python.The libraries used for include Pandas, Scikit-Learn and Catboost.

In order to perform the classification it is possible to analyze two types of data: The images of the posters and the text of the synopsis. Currently, both types of data are easily understood by a human being, but for a machine it is a challenge to analyze and correlate them. Additionally, the problem of the genre classification of films is a challenge in the Machine Learning area because it is a multi-class problem and at the same time multi-genre, that is, the same film can belong to several genres simultaneously. This talk will explain how to make use of deep learning to automate the classification of films thanks to the interpretation of text and images. In detail, the operation and use of convolutional neural networks and transfer learning for image processing on posters will be explained. And, on the other hand, recurrent neural networks will be explained in combination with unsupervised methods (Word2Vec) for the pre-processing and training of the synopsis classification algorithms. Finally, we will talk about how to add the information of both types of data - images and text - in a multi modal neural network to find the genres to which a movie belongs.","Aritificial intelligence, Data Sciece, Machine Learning",,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesus-solano-go,,,Aceptado,Si

jonathanvm13@gmail.com,Jonathan,Vallejo Muñoz,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1T3aY_KbKl8VuAHxuPdN-ZfTsuK6n-_i6,"Hola, soy Jonathan Vallejo Muñoz de Medellín, Colombia. Desde la edad de los 13 años descubrí el poderoso mundo de la computación. Comencé estudiando una técnica en sistemas en la institución educativa del municipio de Bello donde escribí mis primeras lineas de codigo en Visual Basic y desde ese entonces no he dejado de codear hasta hoy en dia. Fui a la universidad Nacional de Colombia sede Medellín y allí continué con mis estudios hasta que en el año 2016 obtuve mi grado como ingeniero de sistemas. En la universidad hice parte de grupos de programación competitiva donde aprendí muchos conceptos importantes de las ciencias de la computación (Grafos, Arboles, Matematicas, Geometria computacional, Programacion dinamica, entre otros) y además participe en competencias a nivel nacional  y continental organizadas por la ACM ICPC y a nivel mundial como el Google Code Jam, Facebook Hacker Cup y maratones en Topcoder (Aquí puedes ver mi perfil con un poco de lo que practique en el Juez Uva Online Judge https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/110886). Toda mi experiencia profesional está ligada a las startups. En el año 2014 fui uno de los cofundadores de Workep (https://workep.com) un gestor de proyectos que aun se encuentra vigente. Durante el año  2016 hice parte de la startup Ctzen (https://ctzen.co), la cual busca conectar los ciudadanos y los problemas de las ciudades con el gobierno de una manera más directa y eficiente. Actualmente me hago parte de la la compañía Lendingfront, una startup Fintech enfocada en soportar las operaciones de bancos o entidades financieras donde su foco de negocio sean los préstamos. Allí he adquirido mi mayor experiencia en cuanto a Python y he tenido que enfrentar muchos retos que me han hecho crecer mucho como profesional, especialmente retos a nivel de performance, mantenibilidad, seguridad, patrones de arquitectura, patrones de diseño, migraciones, liderazgo, gestión de equipos, entre otros. He trabajado con diferentes tecnologías a lo largo de mi experiencia profesional, comenzando con PHP, pasando al mundo Javascript (Node JS / React ), continuando con el mundo Java (Android), programación funcional en Scala y finalmente Python, lenguaje que le he dedicado el 100 % de mi tiempo durante los últimos cuatro años. A parte de mi pasión por el software siempre me he caracterizado por ser una persona curiosa en diferentes tópicos del saber realizando estudios en economía, finanzas, inversiones y liderazgo. En cuanto a mis hobbies, me gusta practicar deporte, especialmente la natación, trotar, montar en bici y hacer trekking. Me gusta viajar, especialmente para conocer nuevas culturas y expandir mi manera de ver el mundo, soy un buceador open water certificado por la NAUI y a futuro quiero convertirme en un un Dive Master y visitar los arrecifes de coral más bellos de todo el mundo (Especialmente la gran barrera de Coral en Australia). Me gustan las fiestas, disfrutar con amigos y familia. Mi interés por dar esta charla es porque uno de mis propósitos en mi vida es impactar la vida de otras personas, y lo quiero materializar haciendo las cosas que más me gustan y en las que tengo mas experiencia, asi que quiero compartir mi conocimiento con la mayor cantidad de personas que pueda y comenzar a aportar en desarrollos open source. Aportando así mi grano de arena en la transformación tecnológica que está ocurriendo en Colombia y en latinoamérica. Amo los animales y apoyo fundaciones que se encargan de los perros y gatos callejeros del municipio de Bello, especialmente la fundación Alma Animal  (https://almanimalmed.wixsite.com/almanimalmed). Mi propósito es crear mi propia fundación en la ciudad de Medellín que pueda sacar la mayor cantidad de Jóvenes de la pobreza y de la violencia, viendo en la tecnología la esperanza para abrir nuevas posibilidades en sus vidas.

However, machine learning models still struggle with a critical element: interpretability. In other words, it is difficult to tell why a machine learning model is making a particular prediction. 

As an alternative to pure machine learning models, statistical inference is a field that provides interpretable models that also quantify the uncertainty of the prediction. Statistical inference can sometimes be challenging to perform, so probabilistic programming is a paradigm that seeks to perform statistical analyses using the tools of computer science. Notably, these computer science tools simplify conducting inference by providing intuitive and efficient implementations of statistical methods.

This talk is about leveraging probabilistic programming to perform statistical inference in a simplified way using Python.
